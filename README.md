# GBAFE Lua Utility Scripts

Scripts for helping analysing GBAFE during runtime.

Use with a lua-capable emulator such as [VBA-ReRecording](https://github.com/TASVideos/vba-rerecording).

## Script List

(there's more, but those are libraries for use from other scripts)

- `draw_proc_tree.lua` - draws the ["proc tree"](http://feuniverse.us/t/guide-doc-asm-procs-or-6cs-coroutines-threads-fibers-funky-structs-whatever/3352?u=stanh) on screen
- `fe6_rng.lua` - draws the next 10 rns on screen and computes how far into the rn string the next double 100 roll is located.
- `map_display.lua` - (FE8U only!) displays the values of each tile for each maps on screen (use numpad+/- to scroll through maps)
